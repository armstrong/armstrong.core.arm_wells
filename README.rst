armstrong.core.arm_wells
========================
Provides the basic content well code necessary for scheduling and arranging
models inside ArmstrongCMS. Conceptually, a well is an ordered grouping of
content that can expire.

.. warning:: This is development level software.  Please do not unless you are
             familiar with what that means and are comfortable using that type
             of software.

Installation
------------

::

    NAME=armstrong.core.arm_wells
    pip install -e git://github.com/armstrong/$NAME.git#egg=$NAME


Usage
-----

Wells utilize GenericForeignKeys to associate content with themselves, so any
model can be placed in a well, regardless of if it inherits from
armstrong.core.arm_content.models.ContentBase

Wells can also be backed by a queryset which will be used as a source of
additional content after all items have been exhausted. Currently, this is not
configurable via the admin, but is easily accomplished by using the
QuerySetBackedWellView. In your urls.py::

    url(r'^$', QuerySetBackedWellView.as_view(well_title='front_page',
                                              template_name="index.html",
                                              queryset=Article.published.all()),
            name='front_page'),
    # get's the current 'front_page' well, backs it with Article.published.all()
    # and renders the index.html page

To render a well we recommend using the armstrong.core.arm_layout module. This
will allow simple templates to handle heterogenous content. For instance, to
render ever item in a well using the 'standard' layout::

    {% load layout_helpers %}
    {% for content in well.items %}
        {% render_model content 'standard' %}
    {% endfor %}
